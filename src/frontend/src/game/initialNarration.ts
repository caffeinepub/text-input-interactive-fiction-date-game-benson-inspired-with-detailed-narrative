You're a few minutes early, which gives you time to take in the scene: the gentle ripple of water, the distant laughter of children being called home, the sweet scent of honeysuckle on the breeze.

Then you see him approaching along the path, and your breath catches slightly. He's exactly as described, yet somehow more striking in person. His spherical head catches the golden light, the colorful orbs inside creating a mesmerizing kaleidoscope effect. He's dressed impeccably in a crisp white shirt and black bow tie, walking with purpose and precision—each step measured, deliberate.

As he draws closer, you notice the slight tension in his shoulders, the way his hands fidget briefly before he clasps them behind his back. He's nervous, you realize, though he's trying hard not to show it. When he reaches the bench, he stops, and for a moment, the orbs in his head swirl a bit faster—a tell, perhaps, of his internal state.

"Good evening," he says, his voice carrying a formal edge that doesn't quite mask an underlying warmth. "I hope you haven't been waiting long. I believe in punctuality, but I also believe in... well, making a good first impression." He pauses, seeming to catch himself being too stiff. "May I sit?"

The moment hangs in the air, full of possibility. This is your chance to set the tone for the evening.`;
