A distinctive figure with a spherical, translucent head filled with colorful orbs, 
reminiscent of a vintage gumball dispenser. His appearance is both whimsical and 
authoritative—the orbs inside shift subtly with his mood, creating an almost hypnotic 
effect. He wears a crisp white shirt with a black bow tie, projecting an air of 
old-fashioned professionalism.

His personality is a fascinating contradiction: outwardly stern and rule-focused, 
with a tendency to become easily flustered when things don't go according to plan. 
Yet beneath this rigid exterior lies a genuine warmth and capacity for connection—
he simply needs the right person to help him relax and see beyond the rulebook.

As a park manager, he takes his responsibilities seriously, perhaps too seriously. 
But on this date, away from the pressures of work, there's a chance to see the 
softer side that rarely gets to shine through.

The park at dusk, where golden hour light filters through the trees and string 
lights begin to twinkle overhead. A peaceful bench overlooks a small pond, and 
the evening air carries the scent of fresh-cut grass and blooming flowers. It's 
the perfect setting for a first date—quiet enough for conversation, beautiful 
enough to inspire romance.
